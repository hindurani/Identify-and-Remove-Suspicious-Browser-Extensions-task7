# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions-task7

## Objective
Learn to identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions to enhance browser security and understand associated risks.

## Tools Used
- **Web Browser**: Google Chrome (Version [Insert Version, e.g., 126.0.6478.127])  
  *Note*: You can use any browser (e.g., Firefox) as per the task guidelines.

## Task Description
This task involves reviewing installed browser extensions, identifying suspicious or unnecessary ones, removing them, and documenting the process. Additionally, it requires researching how malicious extensions can harm users and summarizing key security practices.

## Steps Taken
1. **Opened Extensions Manager**:
   - Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` in Google Chrome to view all installed extensions.
2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions**:
   - Listed all extensions, noting their name, developer, purpose, and permissions.
   - Checked for unrecognized, unused, or suspicious extensions.
3. **Checked Permissions and Reviews**:
   - Viewed permissions for each extension via the "Details" option.
   - Visited the Chrome Web Store to check user reviews and developer credibility.
   - Identified extensions with excessive permissions (e.g., "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit") or poor reviews.
4. **Identified Suspicious/Unused Extensions**:
   - Noted extensions that were unrecognized, had questionable permissions, or were no longer needed.
5. **Removed Extensions**:
   - Removed suspicious or unnecessary extensions by clicking "Remove" in the Extensions Manager.
   - Documented the name, developer, and reason for removal.
6. **Restarted Browser**:
   - Closed and reopened Chrome to apply changes.
   - Observed performance improvements (e.g., faster loading, fewer pop-ups).
7. **Researched Malicious Extensions**:
   - Studied how malicious extensions can steal data, inject ads, or hijack browsers.
   - Researched best practices for safe extension management.
8. **Documented Findings**:
   - Compiled a list of extensions reviewed and removed.
   - Included screenshots and performance observations.

## Extensions Reviewed
| Extension Name | Developer | Permissions | Status | Reason |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| [e.g., AdBlock] | [e.g., AdBlock Inc.] | Access to website data | Kept | Reputable, minimal permissions, actively used |
| [e.g., Unknown Toolbar] | [Unknown] | Access all website data, modify settings | Removed | Unrecognized, excessive permissions, no reviews |

*Note*: Replace the table with actual extensions found in your browser. If no suspicious extensions were found, state: "No suspicious or unnecessary extensions identified."

## Screenshots
- `before.png`: Extensions list before removal.
- `after.png`: Extensions list after removal.

*Note*: Screenshots are included in the repository to show the Extensions Manager before and after the task.

## Observations
- After removing suspicious/unused extensions, the browser showed:
  - [e.g., Faster page loading, no unexpected redirects, or reduced memory usage].
  - [If no extensions were removed]: No performance changes observed as no suspicious extensions were found.

## Research Findings
- **Security Risks of Malicious Extensions**:
  - **Data Theft**: Extensions with access to website data can steal passwords, form inputs, or browsing history.
  - **Malware Delivery**: Some extensions install adware, spyware, or ransomware.
  - **Browser Hijacking**: Malicious extensions may change search engines, homepages, or inject ads.
  - **Performance Issues**: Rogue extensions can slow down the browser or cause crashes.
- **Best Practices for Safe Extension Management**:
  - Install extensions only from official stores (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons).
  - Verify developer reputation and read user reviews before installing.
  - Limit permissions to those necessary for the extensionâ€™s purpose.
  - Regularly review and remove unused extensions.
  - Enable auto-updates to ensure extensions are patched against vulnerabilities.
  - Report malicious extensions via the "Report Abuse" feature on the store.
- **Extension Sandboxing**: A security mechanism that isolates extensions to prevent unauthorized access to the browser or system.
- **Extensions vs. Plugins**: Extensions enhance browser functionality (e.g., ad-blockers), while plugins handle specific content types (e.g., Flash, Java).

## Deliverables
- List of extensions reviewed and removed (if any), as shown in the table above.
- Screenshots (`before.png`, `after.png`) of the Extensions Manager.
- This README.md documenting the process, findings, and research.
- [Optional]: `extension_list.txt` listing all extensions reviewed for reference.

## Notes
- No paid tools were used, as the task only requires a web browser.
- Self-research was conducted using Google, Mozilla support pages, and security blogs to understand extension risks and best practices.
- All errors (if any) were resolved independently to enhance problem-solving skills.
